# akash-dockerfile
I am new to docker, akash, k8s. I've searched for how to buld my own akash miner (provider?) on Unraid, to no avail.
So, I am doing it myself.
I am sure I am making a lot of newbie mistakes..but at least it is out here.
My goal is to mine crypto via akash on Unraid server.
Help welcome.
